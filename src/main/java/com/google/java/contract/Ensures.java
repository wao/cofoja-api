   * The list of postconditions that must be met by the annotated
   * method, written as strings. The expressions must be valid Java
   * code and can reference all things visible to the class, as well
   * as the method's arguments. Since postconditions may need to refer
   * to the old value of an expression and the value returned by the
   * annotated method, the following extensions are allowed:
   *
   * <p>The keyword {@code result} refers to the value returned from
   * the method, if any. It is an error to have a method parameter
   * named {@code result}.
   *
   * <p>The {@code old(expression)} pseudo-method construct refers to
   * the value of its argument before execution of the method.
   * {@code expression} must be a balanced expression, with regard to
   * parentheses. The {@code old()} construct is preprocessed using
   * the following simple rules (similar to macro expansion done by a
   * C preprocessor):
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>the word {@code old}, followed by an opening parenthesis, is
   * recognized as an identifier;
   * <li>the enclosed expression is only parsed for balanced
   * parentheses;
   * <li>textual substitution is used.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>It is an error to call a method named {@code old} from within
   * a postcondition.
